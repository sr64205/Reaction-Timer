# Reaction-Timer
Designed and implemented a reaction timer to measure how long it takes for the user to react to a flash of LEDs using the FPGA board. The time is captured up to a millisecond, and also catches cheating. To implement this design, we designed an FSM, random number generator, and a Clock Divider.
